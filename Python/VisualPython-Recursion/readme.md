## Visual Python: Recursion with Turtles

Lets learn how to use recursion in Python, using turtles! In [this class]((https://skl.sh/2GGvYNm)) you'll gain exposure to:

- Visually oriented lessons. Making following along much easier.
- Recursive concepts, ranging from base cases to call stacks and common mistakes.
- Plenty of Python Turtle operations.
- Problems ranging from almost stupidly simple, to real-world level.

This repo contains the source code for the end of each lesson.
