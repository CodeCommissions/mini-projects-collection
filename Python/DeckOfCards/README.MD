# [Python Essentials: Card Deck Class in 3 Steps](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Python-Essentials-Card-Deck-Class-in-3-Steps/968840398/projects)

This project demonstrates why Classes are useful. 
 - First we pass around the plain list to represent the deck of cards. This gets tedious as that data needs to be tracked and passed around.
 - Next we wrap the existing logic up in a class, so that the logic and data are tightly coupled.

Let us know what you think.
